Drew: Helsing's done a good job of getting ingrained in the Rust community, but a lot of people probably still don't know what it is. Could you give a brief pitch on what Helsing does?
Jon: Helsing is a software-first defense company. There are some companies that have been in the defense industry for ages, and they build primarily hardware, like actual physical weapons, and then they've realised over the past couple of years that they need to introduce more advanced software into the mix. This is because the threat space that we're exposed to is also getting smarter. The adversaries are getting smarter, and so we must also get smarter. So, they are realizing they also need to write software.
